It uses the [Hardcore Questing Mode][hqm] mod to have an in-game quest book to keep track 
of progress through the challenge stages.

The quests attempt to capture the requirements for the "Hard" mode of the construction
challenge, with a few changes to accomodate the more rigid structure of HQM.  The primary
change is that since there's no way to detect if particular buildings have been built or 
not, a basic 'turn in a door' or something similar is used. This obviously makes the 
quests more of an honor system, but does serve well for a 'checklist' of what all needs
to be completed before moving to the next stage.
